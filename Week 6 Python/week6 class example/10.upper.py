#this is how you use the for loop this finds each character in the string a
## no such thing as a do while loop in python 

'''
# this is another way to use for loop

    for i in [0,1,2]

    for i in range(3) # this give 3 time

 # this the while loop

    i = 0
    while i < 3
        i += 1 #cant do i++ in python


'''
#can also use a list for this like for

for c in a:
    print(c.upper(),end = "")

print()
